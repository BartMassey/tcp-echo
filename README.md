# Demo TCP echo client and server

Copyright Â© 2012 Bart Massey

This is a little demo I wrote in my networking class to
illustrate UNIX/Linux TCP programming. It's just like the
hundreds like it all over the Internet. Enjoy.

Server usage:

            echoserver

Client usage:

            echoclient <server-ip-address> <message-to-echo>

The server IP address must be given to the client
numerically, and is usually 127.0.0.1.
